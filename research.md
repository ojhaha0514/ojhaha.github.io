### Publication
#### Enhancing the performance of COVID-19 case forecasting through mathematical modeling
* Authors: **Jooha Oh**, Caterine Apio, and Taesung Park
* Extended the classical SIR model to the SEIQRDV3P model, incorporating three stages of vaccination as new compartments and accounting for the ratio of delta and omicron variants.

<br/>
#### Forecasting the spread of COVID-19 based on policy, vaccination, and Omicron data.
* Authors: Kyulhee Han, Bogyeom Lee, Doeun Lee, Gyujin Heo, **Jooha Oh**, Seoyoung Lee, Catherine Apio, and Taesung Park
* Systematically compared various machine learning prediction models and predictor variables to assess their impact on forecasting COVID-19 indicators.

<br/>
### Preprint/In Progress
#### Enhancing COVID-19 Forecasts Through Multivariate Deep Learning Models
* Authors: **Jooha Oh**, Liu Zhe, and Taesung Park
* Applied a multivariate approach to DL(Deep Learning) models by modifying the input vector into a matrix that includes informative data from other countries.

#### Surrogate Assisted Updating Method considering Partially Missing Covariates across Multiple Studies
* Authors: **Jooha Oh**, and Yei Eun Shin
* Proposed a new methodology that improves relative efficiency compared to existing methods by combining calibration and updating techniques through numerical simulations.

#### Bootstrap-based confidence intervals for infectious disease forecasting models
* Authors: Taewan Goo, Kyulhee Han, Hanbyul Song, Jiwon Park, Zhe Liue, **Jooha Oh**, Sayooj Abi Jose, and Taesung Park
* proposed a generalized framework using bootstrap-based confidence intervals to enhance uncertainty quantification in COVID-19 forecasting models.
