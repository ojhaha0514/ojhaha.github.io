## About me

**Jooha Oh** is a **_B.S. student_**  of [Statistics, Seoul National University](https://stat.snu.ac.kr), with a keen focus on developing statistical methodologies to solve complex healthcare and biological challenges. Combining classical statistics with modern artificial intelligence, Jooha's work bridges these fields to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness in real-world applications.

During his undergraduate studies, Jooha has actively applied his knowledge in biostatistics, machine learning, and causal inference, particularly in public health contexts. Notable projects include creating predictive models for COVID-19 infection rates and developing methods for handling missing data, where he successfully incorporated deep learning and traditional statistical approaches to address limitations in health data analysis. His research interests extend to genetic data, where he is currently investigating Polygenic Risk Scores for cardiovascular disease prediction, integrating insights from molecular biology with statistical frameworks.

In addition to research, Jooha is passionate about collaborative science and values sharing knowledge with the academic community. He has contributed to open-source projects and participated in paper reviews, which reinforce his commitment to advancing the field of biostatistics and making impactful contributions to healthcare and biological sciences.
