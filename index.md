## About me

**Jooha Oh** is a **_B.S. student_**  of [Statistics, Seoul National University](https://stat.snu.ac.kr), with a keen focus on developing statistical methodologies to solve complex healthcare and biological challenges. Combining classical statistics with modern artificial intelligence, Jooha's work bridges these fields to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness in real-world applications.


### Research Interests
* Biostatistics, Machine Learning, Missing Data, Survival Analysis, Causal Inference
* Bioinformatics, Polygenic Risk Scores
* Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Deep learning

### Publication
#### Enhancing the performance of COVID-19 case forecasting through mathematical modeling
* Authors: **Jooha Oh**, Caterine Apio, and Taesung Park
* Extended the classical SIR model to the SEIQRDV3P model, incorporating three stages of vaccination as new compartments and accounting for the ratio of delta and omicron variants.

#### Forecasting the spread of COVID-19 based on policy, vaccination, and Omicron data.
* Authors: Kyulhee Han, Bogyeom Lee, Doeun Lee, Gyujin Heo, **Jooha Oh**, Seoyoung Lee, Catherine Apio, and Taesung Park
* Systematically compared various machine learning prediction models and predictor variables to assess their impact on forecasting COVID-19 indicators.

### Preprint/In Progress
#### Enhancing COVID-19 Forecasts Through Multivariate Deep Learning Models
* Authors: **Jooha Oh**, Liu Zhe, and Taesung Park
* Applied a multivariate approach to DL(Deep Learning) models by modifying the input vector into a matrix that includes informative data from other countries.

#### Surrogate Assisted Updating Method considering Partially Missing Covariates across Multiple Studies
* Authors: **Jooha Oh**, and Yei Eun Shin
* Proposed a new methodology that improves relative efficiency compared to existing methods by combining calibration and updating techniques through numerical simulations.

#### Bootstrap-based confidence intervals for infectious disease forecasting models
* Authors: Taewan Goo, Kyulhee Han, Hanbyul Song, Jiwon Park, Zhe Liue, **Jooha Oh**, Sayooj Abi Jose, and Taesung Park
* proposed a generalized framework using bootstrap-based confidence intervals to enhance uncertainty quantification in COVID-19 forecasting models.
